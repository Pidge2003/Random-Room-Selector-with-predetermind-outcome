I have created a fake website using HTML, CSS and JS to be used to trick your friends when planning things like holidays. The section at the top is used to input the names of the people however it has no affect on the outcome which will always be the same. In my opinion it's a fun trick to play but putting people with who they get on with the least or putting yourself with who you like the most.
